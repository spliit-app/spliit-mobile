# Spliit Mobile

This is the mobile version of [Spliit](https://spliit.app).

*It is still a work in progress, and is not ready for public use.*

Want to be part of the private beta? Send me an email at <sebastien@castiel.me>. (Only for iOS for now.)

## Roadmap

The goal is to release a first version:
- that contains only primary features: create and join groups, create expenses, view balances,
- that targets only iOS, without dark mode.

When this version is ready and public, we'll start working on implementing features that already exist on the web version, and update the app to target Android devices as well.

## Contribute

You're welcome to contribute, but before implementing a feature, please submit an issue to make sure that the feature is on the roadmap for the next release.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   ```
